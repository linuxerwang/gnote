## gnote

It is a golang port of my pretty old pnote using python gtk2.

As gtk2 and python2 is fading I got the option to port to pygtk3 or something else. Recently I just learn golang and like it so this is the result.

Many features is removed as I rarely use them however some new features is added.

I use it to quickly take notes, draft some code snippet and idea, search for error text in a log file (big that load into less or vim is very slow)

And a generic encryption/decyption text as well.

This uses gotk3 GUI and stole many code snippets from the examples there.
